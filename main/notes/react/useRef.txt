# what is a useRef?
=> A useRef in react allows you to create a refference and assign it to a DOM element for example. and then listens for a trigger and performs some action on the reference,
without re-rendering the page or app.

# useRef example:
    import {useRef} from 'react';

    function exampleCompoent = () =>{
        const inputRef = useRef(null)

        const focusInput = () => {
            inputRef.current.focus() //when this function is called, the element with ref as inputRef should focus.
        }
        return (
            <>
                <input type="text" ref={inputRef}/>
                <button onClick={focusInput}> Focus Input <button/> //When this button is clicked, the input is then focused ( this is an event trigger and Dom manipulation, that doesn't require the page to re-render).
            </>
        )
    }
